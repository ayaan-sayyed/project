    <h3> CRICKET</h3>
    <p> Cricket is my favourite sport. I love it very much. I will work hard to become a cricketer. I love the quote said by M.S Dhoni, a very famous cricketer. He says "You don't play for the crowd, you play for the country". I want to be a Batting All-Rounder. Includind Cricket I have four more hobbies that is- Football,Badminton,Coding and listening to Music. </p>
